      "Question: You are working on a time series data set. You manager has asked you to build a high accuracy model. You start with the decision tree algorithm, since you know it works fairly well on all kinds of data. Later, you tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy than decision tree model.

However, you see that in the multiple linear regression, one of the weights on the predictors is negative. What could be the issue?\n",
      "Question: Now you have a feasible amount of predictors, but you’re fairly sure that you don’t need all of them. How would you perform feature selection on the dataset?\n",
      "Question: Your linear regression didn’t run and communicates that there are an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?\n",
